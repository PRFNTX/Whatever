            Xavier Rudd grew up in Jan Juc,[1] near Torquay, Victoria.[2] He attended St Joseph's College, Geelong.[3] His maternal grandfather was Dutch, born in Tilburg, a town in the Netherlands, before migrating to Australia.[4] One of his grandmothers was from an Irish potato-growing family and grew up in Colac, Victoria.[5] His father was born with Aboriginal, Irish and Scottish heritage,[2][6] and Rudd has Wurundjeri background,[7] one of his great grandmothers was an Aboriginal Australian, and her child (Rudd's paternal grandmother) was taken away from her.[8]
            
            Rudd showed a keen interest in music growing up in a family of seven children.[9][10] While primary school-aged, Rudd used his mother's vacuum cleaner as a makeshift didgeridoo and he began playing his brother's guitar.[11] He also played saxophone and clarinet as a child.[12] Rudd's brother can still play guitar, but went on to become an accountant in Orlando, Florida.[13]
            
            As a child, Xavier Rudd sold recycled wood through his own furniture business.[14] Immediately after finishing school, Rudd traveled to Fiji. He lived in villages around the country for nine months, returning to Australia at age 19.[9]
